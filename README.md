# Twitter Style MVC App

This is a Twitter style MVC app built in Node.js with Express and MongoDB.

**Features:**
* Signup
* Login
* Post a comment
* View comments
* Gravatar integration
* User sessions
* Login & Signup validation

## Setup

You will need MongoDB installed locally for the app to work. Though you could modify it to work with a remote database. You will likely need to edit server/config/config.js to add your MongoDB connection details.

Clone this repo, then do:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The site will then be visible at http://localhost:3000.
